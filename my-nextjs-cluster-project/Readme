So, in summary, you're seeing "Server running on http://localhost:8000" 
printed four times because you have four worker processes,
 each handling requests independently.
  And you're seeing "Worker <process.pid> started" with different process IDs 
  because each worker process is a separate instance with its own unique process ID.
